    <h1>Investment Management (Overview)</h1>

    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>Investment Management (IM) uses its functions to support the planning, investment, and financing process in your company when implementing the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Investments in tangible fixed assets, such as acquisitions of assets through in-house production or purchase</li>
        <li>Projects that mainly incur overhead costs, such as education and training, or the acquisition of new markets</li>
        <li>Investments in research and development</li>
        <li>Maintenance programs</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In other words, the term investment is not meant exclusively in the sense of capitalization according to accounting or tax law. An investment can refer to any measure that initially incurs costs and may only lead to income or other benefits (for example, maintenance projects) later on.</p>

    <h2>Implementation Considerations</h2>
    <p>For information on implementing the component, see Customizing for Investment Management, under SAP Customizing Implementation Guide → Investment Management.</p>

    <h2>Integration</h2>
    <p>The investment program and the appropriation requests are original objects of the component IM. To map measures, the component IM uses orders from the components CO-OM-OPA (Internal Orders), PM (Plant Maintenance), and WBS elements from the component PS (Project System).</p>
    <p>The integration with the Asset Accounting (FI-AA) component enables the capitalization of the cost portions of an investment measure that must be capitalized to an asset for internal orders and WBS elements. Cost portions that do not require capitalization can be settled to cost accounting.</p>
    <p>Receipts for a measure can be processed using the logistics components of the SAP system.</p>

    Sales & Distribution Management (SD):<br>
    SAP SD is one of the most important modules in SAP. It has a high level of integration complexity. SAP SD is used by organizations to support sales and distribution activities of products and services, starting from enquiry to order and then ending with delivery.<br>
    SAP SD can monitor a plethora of activities that take place in an organization such as products enquires, quotation (pre-sales activities), placing order, pricing, scheduling deliveries (sales activity), picking, packing, goods issue, shipment of products to customers, delivery of products and billings.<br>
    In all these processes, multiple modules are involved such as FI (Finance Accounting), CO (Controlling), MM (Material Management), PP (Production Planning), LE (Logistics Execution), etc., which shows the complexity of the integration involved.<br>
    
    <br><br><br>
    Activities Involved in SAP SD<br>
    •	Setting up Organization Structure (creation of new company, company codes, sales organization, distribution channels, divisions, business area, plants, sales area, maintaining sales offices, storage location)<br>
    •	Assigning Organizational Units (Assignment of individual components created in the above activities with each other according to design like company code to company, sales organization to company code, distribution channel to sales organization, etc.)<br>
    •	Defining Pricing Components (Defining condition tables, condition types, condition sequences)<br>
    •	Setting up sales document types, billing types, and tax-related components<br>
    •	Setting up Customer master data records and configuration<br>
    <br><br>
    Material Management (MM):<br>
    Material Management deals with movement of materials via other modules like logistics, supply chain management, sales and delivery, warehouse management, production and planning.<br>
    <br>
    <img src="F:\titan\Pictures\MM.jpg"><br><br>
    
    Logistic Execution (LE)<br>
    Logistic Execution can be divided into two sub-modules, i.e., shipment of goods (purchase to procurement process) and warehouse management (storage of goods). These two modules are integrated with sale and distribution, material management, and production and planning.<br>

    <br><br><br><br>
    Supplier Relationship Management (SRM)
    As the name SRM suggests, this module deals with the effective and efficient transition of products and services between an organization and its suppliers. The main process covered in this section is procurement of products like direct materials, indirect materials, and services. This module can effectively integrate with planning, accounting, and inventory system.

    <br><br><br>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    End-to-End Procurement Cycle<br>
    <br><br>Procurement process with SAP Enterprise Buyer comprises of the following major steps −
    <br>•	Shopping Carts
    <br>•	Approval of Shopping Cart
    <br>•	Sourcing of Requirements
    <br>•	Purchase Orders
    <br>•	Purchase Order Approval
    <br>•	Confirm Goods/Services
    <br>•	Confirmation Approval
    <br>•	Process Invoice
    <br>•	Invoice Approval
    <br><br><br>Customer Relationship Management (CRM)
    <br>CRM deals with end-to-end customer related processes. CRM is designed to centralize the data related to all the customers associated with an organization. It helps an organization −
    <br>•	Maintain its sales, services, and build marketing strategies according the market demand and customer data analysis.
    <br>•	Remain focused on its customers and via information analysis, help the business to know more about its customers.
    <br>•	Improve sales and services and building better relationships with customers.
     
    
    <br>
    <img src="F:\titan\Pictures\cos_res_man.jpg">
    <br><br>Human Resource (HR)
    <br><br>The most important objective of master data administration in Human Resources is to enter employee-related data for administrative, time-recording, and payroll purposes.
    <br>A new employee can be hired without using Recruitment. Instead you can hire someone by running a personnel action in Personnel Administration, thereby creating the necessary data for the employee to be hired.
    <br>Employee data must be kept current. After an employee is hired, circumstances can always arise which necessitate either the entry of new data or the correction of current data. For instance −
    <br>•	An employee moves to his or her new address must be stored in the system.
    <br>•	An employee gets a pay hike at the start of the year. The new salary must be stored for the relevant date.
    <br>•	An employee changes jobs within the organization. His or her organizational assignment, working time, and salary also change.
    <br>•	Data can be stored for the past, present, or future.
    Note  Entering payroll-relevant data in the past triggers retroactive accounting.

    <br><br>
    
    
    
    
    The HR module is comprised of major areas of functionality known as sub-modules. The HR module is a true demonstration of the strength of the SAP product in Enterprise Resource Planning.
    <br>The HR system has very strong integration points (where data is passed back and forth without human intervention) with just about all of the other SAP modules. In addition, there is very tight integration amongst the HR sub-modules.
    <br>The above illustration highlights some of the basic SAP HR terms as listed below.
    <br><br>•	Business trip management
    <br>•	Recruitment
    <br>•	Payroll
    <br>•	Personal development
    <br>•	Organizational Management
