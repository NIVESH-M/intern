<br><br><h2>WORKING PROCESS OF SAP:</h2>
<p>
        SAP ERP software is one of the most complex ERP systems. So, the question is, how does SAP work? And can it offer flexibility and scalability despite its complexity?<br><br>

Yes it’s a three-tier system, compromising the presentation, the application, and the database tier. This design makes SAP ERP solutions user friendly, easy to scale, and highly customizable.<br><br>

<h3>The Presentation Tier: </h3>This tier is the SAP graphical user interface or SAP GUI. This is where users can send the input and see the output. You can install it on a Mac or Windows computer.
<h3>The Application Tier: </h3>It’s the connecting link between the user interface and the database. This tier executes business logic, runs processes, and controls access to the database.
<h3>The Database Tier:</h3> This is where business (user) and application data get stored. It’s essentially a memory bank of your entire SAP ERP system. <br><br>
<p>Although the system is complex and requires step-by-step implementation, it offers several advantages. One of the most lauded benefits of SAP includes its ability to integrate with other third-party systems. With effortless third-party integration, you can implement enterprise-wide solutions and improve overall productivity.

Each SAP module also comes with tones of analytical features, flexibility to create customised rules, and the ability to standardise your business processes.
