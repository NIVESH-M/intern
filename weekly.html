                <h4>INTRODUCTION TO SAP</h4>
                <P>SAP stands for Systems, Applications, and Products in Data Processing. It’s a German multinational software corporation that provides enterprise resource planning (ERP) software to manage business operations and customer relations. SAP software helps companies manage their financials, logistics, supply chain, human resources, and other business functions. The SAP ERP system integrates all data and processes of an organization into a unified system.
